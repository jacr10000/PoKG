PoKG is a knowledge graph that contains the first generation (151 instances) of pokemon (including types introduced in later generations but updated to the first one).

The choice of this topic is due to the wide variety of pokemon with different types and relations between each other, that constitute an already established, diverse set that can be subject of many query types.
